# PostingListWithHashing
Once the program receives an input word, it generates its key index using a hashing function and then jumps to that index in the array and prints the content of all nodes of that linked list.

Example:

- (Program:) Enter a word: 
- (user:) EWord1 
- (Pgogram:) this word has been appeared in the following text files: 1.txt, 4.txt
--------------------
- (Program:) Enter a word: 
- (user:) EWord2 
- (Program:) this word has been appeared in the following text files: 3.txt
--------------------
- (Program:) Enter a word: 
- (user:) EWord3 
- (Program:) No text files includes this word.
